OSM 社群歡迎研究團隊，而從加德滿都到柏林，有不少人研究過 OSM - 以及社群、專案、以及資料。要開始之前，我們鼓勵你與在地社群接洽，從而檢視 OSM 已經存在的研究成果。

有個研究主題的郵件論壇：<a href="mailto:research-announce@lists.openstreetmap.org">research-announce@lists.openstreetmap.org</a>.

如何進行與署名開放街圖的方式與建議在[這邊](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Researcher_Information){:target="_blank"}.

You can find details on Google Scholar or other web sources that include articles, but here are [some examples](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Research){:target="_blank"} to help you get started.

**Could OSM provide a letter of support for our research project?**

As OSM is a distributed, global community with diverse expertise, OSM does not provide an exclusive letter of support for any given topic. We encourage researchers to connect with their local OSM community and/or chapter. The benefit of researchers working within the community is that they can seek guidance and context about the work which will add value to the end product.

For these reasons, the OSMF Board does not formally give letters of support for research. We do, however, recommend that you contact previous researchers to build on their work. During your research journey, we do encourage you to connect with the community, join the events and share your research. Many researchers have presented at the various State of the Map events around the world. Their perspectives are very welcome and contribute to the corpus of OSM knowledge.
